Upload all DICOMS from CD and multiple folders

Making public instead of deleting repo. This was an upload script to find DICOM files and send to the imagenet app (discontinued Ruby on Rails cloud app) that stored, showed and shared medical images like CT, X-ray, MRI with other physicians for second opinions. Health care isn't the easiest industry for startups when you are small #lessonslearned. We believe in the concept though, so if you dropped in here by chance, find us at rubynor.com to get our advice and discovering ways to work together :) #nevergiveup
